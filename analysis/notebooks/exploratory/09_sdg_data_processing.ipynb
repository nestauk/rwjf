       "'\\n\\n\\nThe European PVC industry commits to address five key challenges:- Work towards the more efficient management of PVC throughout its life cycle.- Help to ensure that persistent organic compounds do not accumulate in nature and that other emissions are reduced. - Review the use of PVC additives and move towards more sustainable additives systems.- Help to minimize climate impacts through reducing energy and raw material use, potentially endeavoring to switch to renewable sources and promoting sustainable innovation.- Continue to build sustainability awareness across the value chain and external stakeholders.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn line with the Agenda 21 chapter 30 Strengthening the role of business and industry, the VinylPlus Voluntary Commitment has been developed bottom up with an open process of stakeholder dialogue. Five key sustainable development challenges have been identified for PVC, based on The Natural Step System Conditions for a Sustainable Society. VinylPlus considers the dialogue with all of its stakeholders and the involvement of an NGO as critical external friend a key factor for success.Specific Task Forces, composed of internal and external experts, provide guidelines and define approach and implementation tools to achieve the set targets.In this regard, it is of paramount importance a cradle to grave approach, involving the entire upstream and downstream chain from raw-material production to post-consumer waste. Sustainable consumption and production are only achievable looking at the entire life cycle of product and actively involving SMEs.With reference to the chapter V of JPOI, VinylPlus is cooperating with the EU new members and trade unions with the objective of raising health, safety, and environmental standards to higher levels and to harmonize sustainability goals. Furthermore, VinylPlus will engage in efforts to globalize the approach by encouraging similar voluntary initiatives elsewhere in the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs part of its commitment to promote its approach across the PVC industry worldwide, VinylPlus actively shares experience, knowledge and best practices with the other regional PVC associations at the global level in the bi-annual meetings of the GVC (Global Vinyl Council), as well as in other relevant conferences and events.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVinylPlus is managed by a comprehensive Board representing all European PVC industry sectors (resin and additives producers, plastics manufacturers).A Monitoring Committee guarantees an independent evaluation of the initiatives undertaken in the framework of the Voluntary Commitment and gives guidance and advice. Open to external stakeholders, the Committee currently includes representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament, trade unions and consumer associations, as well as representatives from the European PVC industry.

       "\"Achieving the United Nations’ 17\\xa0Sustainable Development\\xa0Goals (SDGs) results in many ecological, social, and economic consequences that are inter-related. Understanding relationships between sustainability goals and determining their interactions can help prioritize effective and efficient policy options. This paper presents a framework that integrates existing knowledge from literature and expert opinions to rapidly assess the relationships between one SDG goal and another. Specifically, given the important role of the oceans in the world's social-ecological systems, this study focuses on how SDG 14 (Life Below Water), and the targets within that goal, contributes to other SDG goals. This framework differentiates relationships based on compatibility (co-benefit, trade-off, neutral), the optional nature of achieving one goal in attaining another, and whether these relationships are context dependent. The results from applying this framework indicate that oceans SDG targets are related to all other SDG goals, with two ocean targets (of seven in total) most related across all other SDG goals. Firstly, the ocean SDG target to increase economic benefits to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries for sustainable marine uses has positive relationships across all SDGs. Secondly, the ocean SDG target to eliminate\\xa0overfishing, illegal and destructive fishing practices is a necessary pre-condition for achieving the largest number of other SDG targets. This study highlights the importance of the oceans in achieving sustainable development. The rapid assessment framework can be applied to other SDGs to comprehensively map out the subset of targets that are also pivotal in achieving sustainable development.\""
